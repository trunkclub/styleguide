Trunk Club Code Style Guide
==========

## The Golden Rule

All code in the codebase should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contribute.

## In general

- do not commit commented-out code to master
- don't leave `TODO`s, `FIXME`s or `BUG`s in the code, but if you do use `TODO`, `FIXME` or `BUG` in your comment
- comments left in the code should be timeless, e.g. always applicable until they're removed

<a name="whitespace"></a>
## Whitespace

* Use whitespace to improve readability.
* Use 2 spaces for indentation.
* Don't use more than one blank line as a separator.
* Strip all end-of-line whitespace.
* Ensure file ends with one line-break.
