Trunk Club Coding Style Guide
==========

## The Golden Rule

All code in the codebase should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contribute.

## In general

- do not commit commented-out code to master
- don't leave `TODO`s, `FIXME`s or `BUG`s in the code, but if you do use `TODO`, `FIXME` or `BUG` in your comment
- comments left in the code should be timeless, e.g. always applicable until they're removed
